# Digital-Clock-Project-JS
In this project Digital-Clock is developed by using only JS.JS is a very powerfull and vast language that's why by having a strong logic and mind a developer can develop any things he wants by using this language.Both digital and analog clock can be developed by using JS.In the JS part of this project I have used setInterval() method and new Date() method to develop the functionality of any basic digital clock.




Some Important JS Methods or functions used:

1: setInterval(): https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp
2: new Date(): https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_dates.asp
